## Post-Incident Summary of Detection, Analysis, and Mitigation Efforts

### Executive Summary

This report provides an analysis of recent security incidents targeting our CRM system. The focus is on identifying the threat actors, understanding their attack methods, and providing recommendations for enhancing our security posture.

### Detection

During routine analysis, we detected high-volume traffic causing `Error: 429` (3.8M requests over 24 hours) on an internal micro-service node. The incident was initially flagged by automated systems alerting to the unusual traffic patterns consistent with a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. 

```bash
Error: 429 Too Many Requests
```

### Analysis

Further investigation revealed malicious traffic, including SSL injection attempts. The offending IP was traced:

```plaintext
IP Address: 165.227.72.206
```

Analysis of the traffic patterns and payloads confirmed the nature of the attack. A deep dive into system logs, using Defender Cloud SIEM, uncovered the specific endpoints targeted. 

```plaintext
Malicious Payload:
Gh0st\xAD\x00\x00\x00\x00\xE0\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x9C\xSS`...
```

### Mitigation

Immediate steps were taken to remediate the attack, applying the threat mitigation recommendations. These included policy amendments and an urgent update to our SSL configurations, tightening rules to block similar future injection attempts. Security automation tools, like Shuffle SOAR, were crucial in orchestrating a rapid response.

Policy amendments included:

```yaml
- block: 165.227.72.206
- rate_limit: /api/* to 100r/m
- ssl_profile: tighten cipher suites
```

Further details on the remediation process can be found in the [Threat Mitigation Recommendations](https://chrisoldfield.github.io/portfolio/threat-mitigation) document.

### Conclusion

This incident underscores the need for continuous monitoring and rapid response systems in place. Post-incident, we've implemented additional logging and network monitoring through tools like Wireshark and ACHunter, as suggested in our [SOC Operations Manual](https://chrisoldfield.github.io/portfolio/soc-operations). Our team remains vigilant and prepared to act swiftly against any future cybersecurity threats.
