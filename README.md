With over seven years of experience in the IT and application support fields, I've developed a deep interest in cybersecurity through my roles at Repfabric and my military service. My goal is to leverage my background in IT, passion for technology, and dedication to solving complex problems to make a meaningful impact in the cybersecurity domain.

## Objective

I am currently expanding my skills in cybersecurity with an emphasis on SOC operations and threat mitigation.
